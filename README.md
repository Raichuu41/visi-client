# WASM with AssemblyScript

    TODO ADDED:
        1. cummincate between js and AS
        2. pass buffer to AS
        3. Add Node Class to save pointer and size => get acces to pixel data for each img
        4. add Store for saving nodes and operation on multi nodes
        5. pixel array for return data and change via AS
        6. Add draw to state and nodes
        7. add test canvas for showing result
        8. add variable memory based on canvasPixelSize and change cavnas size to 100, 100
        9. add real pictures while streaming, first 10, handcrafted x,y,
            init memory 10 * 10 * 10 * 4 = 4000
        10. init full downloaded memory
        11. add all nodes with smallest img size to state
        11. add scale, transfer to node.draw(s, t) with functions to change them
        13. resize full canvas to 500, 500
        14. node.draw() checks if node should be drawed
        15. add new load wasm with webpack, imports add logging
        16. add panning (MouseMove), scale/translate change (zoom)
        17. add 10 files of images to Node and resize with zooming
        18. fix draw placing wrong pixel and missing content after high zooming

    Missing: 
    Memory: 
        - add dynamic alloc memory (1) (actuall is overwriting) 
    Scissior:
        - add drawRectangle(x, y, w, h) + integrate with drawScissior (2)
    Marks/Groups
        - add node.mark flag, mark them on click and draw marked rectangle (1)  
        - add node.groupId (default 0), .setGroupId(newId, r, g, b, a)
        - add draw border around group with color if groupId !== 0 (1)
        - add getGroupCount(groupId) (test this with 10k imgs and 10 groups)
        - add changeGroupColor(groupid, r, g, b, a) 
        - add node move, groups move, marked moves
        - add second array for getting pixel under mouse

    TODO Enhancment
        - new Way in a worker
